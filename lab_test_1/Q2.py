class RectangleAI:
    """
    AI-Generated Docstring:
    -----------------------
    Represents a rectangle defined by its width and height. 
    Provides methods to compute the geometric area and perimeter.
    
    Attributes:
        width (float): The horizontal length of the rectangle.
        height (float): The vertical length of the rectangle.
    
    Methods:
        area(): Returns the area of the rectangle (width × height).
        perimeter(): Returns the perimeter (2 × (width + height)).

    def area(self):

        # Area is computed by multiplying width and height.
        return self.width * self.height

        # AI-generated inline comment:
        # Perimeter is calculated as twice the sum of width and height.

    Manually Written Docstring:
    ---------------------------
    A simple Rectangle class that supports computation of area and perimeter.
    
    This class is intentionally documented by hand to contrast with
    the automatically generated version above. Its purpose is identical,
    but the writing style is more concise and human-tailored.

    Parameters:
        width (float): The rectangle's width.
        height (float): The rectangle's height.

    Functions:
        area(): Compute and return width * height.
        perimeter(): Compute and return 2 * (width + height).
